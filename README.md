# Mines Betting Game

This is a fun, non-monetary version of the popular Mines game inspired by stake.games. The game allows you to place a bet (just for fun, no actual money is required) and attempt to avoid mines while uncovering diamonds to increase your multiplier and cash out.


## How to Play

1. **Place Your Bet:**  
   Enter the amount you'd like to bet (just for fun, no real money involved).
   
2. **Choose Number of Mines:**  
   Set the number of mines on the board (between 1 and 24).
   
3. **Start the Game:**  
   Click on the "Start Game" button to begin. The game will randomly place mines on the board.
   
4. **Reveal Tiles:**  
   Click on the tiles to reveal what's underneath. If you uncover a diamond, your multiplier increases. If you hit a mine, the game is over and you'll lose your bet.
   
5. **Cash Out:**  
   If you want to stop before hitting a mine, you can click the "Cash Out" button to claim your winnings based on your current multiplier.
